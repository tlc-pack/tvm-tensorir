    Replay Trace Search Strategy is a search strategy that always replays the trace by removing its
    decisions so that the decisions would be randomly re-generated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_trials_per_iter : int
        Number of trials per iteration.
    num_trials_total : int
        Total number of trials.
    population : int
        The initial population of traces from measured samples and randomly generated samples.
    max_replay_fail_cnt : int
        The maximum number to fail trace replaying.
    init_measured_ratio : int
        The ratio of measured samples in the initial population.
    genetic_algo_iters : int
        The number of iterations for genetic algorithm.
    max_evolve_fail_cnt : int
        The maximum number to retry mutation.
    p_mutate : float
        The probability of mutation.
    eps_greedy : float
        The ratio of greedy selected samples in the final picks.
    database : Database
        The database used in the search.
    cost_model : CostModel
        The cost model used in the search.
